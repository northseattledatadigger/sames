    1.  Put tests in SamesTop lib, and figure out way to compile it as a lib at that top point, along with SB*.rs.
    2.  Figure out the inclusion problem for project level use of SB and SamesTop.
    3.  Finish coding the bin/rust.main.neophyte, getting it to compile and run.
    4.  Make sure all acceptance tests pass.
    5.  Close out with formalities to move on to Javascript.

    6.  Future:
        i.  Do naive version adding in cleanups after reading the form and re-reading all of documentation.
        ii. Begin to plan a "native" version, probably about a year from now.
