    0.  Reorg lrustxc.bash
    1.  Get all four languages working over here.
    2.  Begin making usage of names regular, probably allying most with the rust amateur code.
    3.  Get some tests started with the rust code.
    4.  Finish adding in all the features, adding and testing tests along the way.
    5.  Add in central scripts, probably ONLY in each project, but as much the same as possible, avoiding needless boilerplate.
    6.  Add to docs, improving explanation, and clarifying usage to recommend ONLY runs within each project folder.
    7.  review this plan.
