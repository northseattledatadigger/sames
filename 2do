    2.  Re-organize both Python3 and Ruby versions:
        i.      Main routines need clean up and a little reorganizing.
        ii.     Acceptance driver over all apps.
        iii.    Assess next version steps for:
            a.  Polars
            b.  Pandas
            c.  amateur versus native
            d.  naive versus native
            e.  perhaps also use draftn versions, at least temporarily.
    3.  Begin to plan and code Rust version.
    4.  Perhaps intermittently re-visit 2/iii. and do one of these as a side project when Rust gets hard.
    5.  Study other apps:
        i.      R.
        ii.     PSPP.
        iii.    Datamash.
        iv.     Gnuplot.
        v.      Octave.
    6.  Re-visit doc files.
    7.  When some things have progressed, make a clean version locally and check Sames in that form into the more known github account.
    8.  On 7 being done, make a new static resume in HTML.
    9.  On 8 being done, make limited announcement of draft and begin to use in job applications
    
Done:
    1.  Finish app and make it comply with acceptance tests.
