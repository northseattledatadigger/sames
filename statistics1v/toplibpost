(getting back after holidays) My next sub-project is to figure out how to link a common top library to a lot of different and independently compiling sub-libraries. Basically I have this project demo tree and I want a common resource library with things that will be used in all the projects, partly as a convenience and avoiding duplicate work, but also to impose some common patterns across all the projects. I am guessing there are several options:
Independent cargo builds then the project level then can link in the top library as an independent thing.
Independent top cargo build but perhaps somehow the lower level cargo builds can know about the top level one to do things like chain the build there.
Just copy the files into the project cargo build area and forget about the independent binary.
I would really like to do 2, if possible, and I can already figure out 3,
but I would also really like feedback about both what people commonly do, and any known advantages or disadvantages to each of the three.
Thank you for any feedback.
