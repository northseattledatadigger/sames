    1.  Re-review automation tests
        a.      First make corrections on known calculation errors found in genSummaryStatistics method.
        b.      Go back through and fix subsequent obvious and easy problems.
        c.      Now completely review all areas, and get place-holders for each one, with nice separations and reducing size of sets of things tested in most cases.
        d.      Look at perhaps breaking out from simple-tests to complex tests.  Simple might just be small n with simple xs, then double and full use of decimals for second.
        e.      When that is all done, then begin ruby.main app.
