    2.  Second of two passes for the day:
        c.      try to pick up anything remaining that might be missed, and write tests or code with tests.

    3.  Start working on TableVector stuff.

        i.      Try to nail down best method for multiple classes in the same vector.
        ii.     Bring over ruby code and start translating.
        iii.    Bring over ruby tests for reference commented out, but translate as things become stuck.

    4.  Plan last steps:

        x.      Extended tests, probably in form of Rust integration tests.
        y.      bin/rust.main.neophyte
        z.      Acceptance tests.

    5.  Be aware of Javascript / Node goals next.

    6.  Be hopeful about Ruby latex and HTML document generation soon.

    7.  Try to get better draft of resume tool into sames, perhaps doing a Python3, Node and even Rust version.

Done:
    X1.  One of two more passes for the day to cover:
    X   a.      global procedures.
    X   b.      Empty tests already added to bottom.
