    1.  First thing:  
        a) Now that I am in Rust, I realize the more sane thing is make frequency cells all strings both to homogenize for best comparison, and as an easier step for all languages,
        as even though some make it easy to both have 5555 and '5555', doing so is not helpful.  So refactor generateModefromFrequencyAA(faaA) and put present versions in
        "disfavored".  So:
            i.      Put single type version up in Rust with tests.
            ii.     Make disfavored copies of Python3 and Ruby libraries.
            iii.    Correct in Ruby and Python3 to just use strings alone in Discrete and frequency AAs.

    2.  Try to get all the global routines done today in Rust.
