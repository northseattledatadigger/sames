# Sources

All the csv files used here, unless otherwise specified, are from Data.gov.

The first of these I got sifting through results from search term "walk".  I
then found out once I downloaded the files, I wasn't able to re-find the file
with the filename as a search term.  That may be a future project I'll take
up, and if it becomes a good result programming project, I shall want to
refer to whereever I put it from here:  TBD.

First three files I selected were:

-rw-rw-r-- 1 nsdd nsdd   913 Oct 31 19:07 california-adults-who-met-physical-activity-guidelines-for-americans-2013.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nsdd nsdd 24295 Oct 31 19:09 DEEP_Trails_Set.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 nsdd nsdd  7265 Oct 31 19:18 Pedestrian_Space_Added.csv

Criteria was they were small.  Early drafts had another which I lost
the original filename for.  It has cksum:  189260158.  I include a
truncated version of it as:

-rw-rw-r-- 1 nsdd nsdd 18604 Oct 31 19:32 doexampledata.truncated.csv

Some initial unit tests are on this.
