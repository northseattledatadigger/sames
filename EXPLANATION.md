My plan is to get two more languages, Javascript and Rust, represented in these working libraries before my 65th birthday in December.  As of just a bit ago, I got the Python3 app compliant with my present set of acceptance tests in the first, statistics1v project.  I also hope, before end of year, to get some graph representations implemented.  The github for the project is:
https://github.com/northseattledatadigger/sames.git
My objectives are:
1.  To use this to demonstrate my skills to potential employers.2.  As a teaching tool to share with friends or use in teaching sessions.3.  To provide to anyone wanting to see how to do something to those who know one language, and want examples on how to do it in another I have implemented the function in.4.  As a progressive example of productive sharing activity.
