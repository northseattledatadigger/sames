# My Motivation for this Project

My unique idea of this project is that I will be making a more ideal
contribution by contributing to some kind of rising tide, even a little bit,
if I can, rather than building tools and frameworks to help some organization
make money, I can make a pool of like translation examples that help lots of
people how to do the same thing.  Ideally, this will empower the pool, though
it will lower the income of the individuals.  That will be good if more people,
through understanding the tech can see a common interest in wielding the
knowledge.  Ideally, to me, a pool of educated and enlightened workers naturally
holding power over an economic system is far less risky, far more stable, and
far far less foolish, than a small group of ignoramous inheritors of wealth.

These assertions are around a large mass of competing factors.  I have thought
a lot about many of these.  My experience is the only arguments against this
reasoning always comes from those who have more greed than actual concern over
such matters.  However, the details themselves, here and in the other details I
propose to promulgate, are what sell.

It is fundamental to much thinking that knowledge is a currency that must be
kept tight for transactions, and not over-shared for fear of diminishing their
value.  The open-source movement has clearly disproven this.  However, that does
not change the fact that we are living in a finite world with incentives to
individuals to hold back, as well as incentives to lie to hide value.  I think
the only way to get past our impending population crash doom is to build
cooperation with a kind of democracy of knowledge.  Without such a social
system we face utter destruction of the ecosystems we depend upon.  So, I say
let us share the vital aspects of the knowledge at every step.  The pieces,
purveyed with maximal knowledge, are the best way to constrain destruction while
preserving lives in reasonable levels of dignity.  Obviously, what we are doing
now to the contrary is not accomplishing this, and clearly what I am proposing
has succeeded elsewhere and throughout history.  So, the way to repress
the abberation is to do so with knowledge, to mitigate with ethics leveraged
by maximum understanding.
